I want the json tree to be expandable. When starting is should start collapsed with only showing the root node. When clicking on the link-dot the respective child should be drawn (with the according link)
Each child object should allow to expand it's own children in the same way.

Acceptance criteria:

1. Upon start, only root object is shown
2. when clicking on a link-dot the respective child is drawn with the link connecting it to its parent
3. when clicking an already expanded link-dot, the child should collapse (remove link and child object)
   3.1) if a child is collapsed all its nested children are to be collapsed as well

## 0. Implementation plan

### 1. State Management for Expansion

- Maintain a state (e.g., a Set of expanded node paths or IDs) in the D3Visualization component to track which nodes are expanded.
- The root node is always expanded at first, all others are collapsed.

### 2. Data Preparation

- When building the D3 hierarchy, only include children for nodes whose path/ID is in the expanded set.
- For collapsed nodes, do not include their children in the hierarchy.

### 3. Rendering

- Render only the visible nodes and links based on the current expanded state.
- Each link-dot (the circle at the right edge of a node) should be clickable.

### 4. Interaction

- On clicking a link-dot:
  - If the child is collapsed, add its path/ID to the expanded set (expand it).
  - If the child is expanded, remove its path/ID and all its descendants from the expanded set (collapse it and all nested children).

### 5. Visual Feedback

- Optionally, style the link-dot differently if the child is expanded vs. collapsed (e.g., filled vs. hollow).

### 6. Key Details

- Each node must have a unique path or ID (e.g., a string path like root/child1/child2).
- The D3 rendering logic must be updated to use only the visible part of the tree.

If you confirm this plan, I will proceed to implement it in `D3Visualization.tsx`. Let me know if you want any adjustments or have questions!

## 1. Project Overview

- This is a Visual Studio Code extension named "json-visualizer."
- Its purpose is to visualize JSON data in an interactive way inside VS Code, using a webview powered by a React + D3.js frontend.

## 2. Extension Backend (VS Code Side)

**Key file:**

- `src/extension.ts`
  - Registers the command `d3Visualizer.visualizeVariable`.
  - When triggered, it opens a webview panel (if not already open).
  - Loads the built React app from `media/assets/index.js` and `media/assets/index.css`.
  - Posts a mock JSON object to the webview as an initial payload.
  - Handles webview lifecycle (disposal, etc.).
  - Uses a nonce for CSP security.

**Manifest:**

- `package.json`
  - Declares the extension, its activation events, and the command.
  - Contributes the command to the editor context menu (for Python files).
  - Specifies build/test/lint scripts and dev dependencies.

## 3. Webview Frontend (React + D3)

**Frontend project location:**

- `webview-ui/`

**Build system:**

- Uses Vite (`vite.config.ts`) for fast development and building.
- Output is placed in `../media` for the extension to serve.

**Entry point:**

- `webview-ui/src/main.tsx`
  - Renders the `App` component into the `#root` div.

**Main App:**

- `webview-ui/src/App.tsx`
  - Manages the JSON string state.
  - Parses JSON and builds a hierarchical structure for visualization.
  - Renders two panes: a JSON editor and a D3 visualization.
  - Handles error display for invalid JSON.

**Components:**

- `webview-ui/src/components/JsonEditor.tsx`
  - Simple textarea for editing JSON, with error display.
- `webview-ui/src/components/D3Visualization.tsx`
  - Uses D3.js to render a tree visualization of the JSON hierarchy.
  - Handles layout, node rendering, links, zoom/pan, and interactive highlighting.

**Utilities:**

- `webview-ui/src/utils/parser.ts`
  - Converts arbitrary JSON into a hierarchical structure suitable for D3.
  - Handles objects, arrays, primitives, and circular references.
- `webview-ui/src/utils/types.ts`
  - Type definitions for the hierarchical data structure.

**Styling:**

- `webview-ui/src/styles/App.css`
  - Custom styles for layout, editor, visualization, and D3 nodes/links.
- `webview-ui/src/index.css`
  - Base styles, color schemes, and resets.

**HTML Entrypoint:**

- `webview-ui/index.html`
  - Loads the React app into `#root`.

**Configuration:**

- TypeScript configs: `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`
- ESLint config: `eslint.config.js`
- Package manifest: `package.json` (declares dependencies: React, D3, etc.)

## 4. Media Output

- `media/index.html` and assets: Output of the frontend build, served by the extension's webview.

## 5. Testing

- `src/test/extension.test.ts`
  - Contains a sample test suite for the extension backend (not for the frontend).

## 6. Documentation

- `README.md` (root): Placeholder for extension documentation.
- `webview-ui/README.md`: Describes the React+Vite template and ESLint setup.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Change log for the extension.
- `vsc-extension-quickstart.md`: VS Code extension development quickstart.

## 7. Project Structure and Build

- `.vscode/`: VS Code workspace settings, tasks, and launch configs.
- `.gitignore`, `.vscodeignore`: Ignore patterns for git and VSIX packaging.

**Summary of Data Flow:**

- The extension is activated by a command.
- It opens a webview and loads the React app.
- The extension can post messages (JSON data) to the webview.
- The React app parses and visualizes the JSON using D3.
- The user can edit the JSON in the webview, and the visualization updates in real time.

**Key Technologies:**

- VS Code Extension API (TypeScript)
- React (frontend)
- D3.js (visualization)
- Vite (build tool)
- TypeScript (type safety)

If you need a breakdown of any specific part (e.g., D3 rendering, extension-webview communication, error handling, etc.), let me know!Here is a deep-dive analysis of your codebase, based on the provided files and structure:

## Project Overview

This is a Visual Studio Code extension named `json-visualizer`. Its purpose is to provide a way to visualize (and possibly edit) JSON data within VS Code, using a custom webview UI built with React, D3.js, and Vite.

---

## 1. Extension Backend (VS Code Side)

- **Entry Point:** extension.ts

  - Registers the command `d3Visualizer.visualizeVariable`, which appears in the context menu for Python files.
  - When triggered, it:
    - Gets the current selection in the editor.
    - Creates a mock JSON object using the selected text as the name.
    - Opens a webview panel (if not already open) and loads the UI from index.js and index.css.
    - Posts the mock JSON to the webview via `postMessage`.
  - Uses a nonce for security in the webview.
  - The extension is set up to only contribute a single command, and only for Python files.

- **Build & Test:**

  - TypeScript is used for the extension code.
  - Build output goes to out.
  - Linting is set up with ESLint and TypeScript ESLint plugin.
  - Testing uses `@vscode/test-cli` and Mocha types.
  - There is a sample test in extension.test.ts.

- **Packaging:**
  - .vscodeignore excludes dev files, source, and config from the VSIX package.
  - .gitignore and .vscode-test.mjs are set up for typical extension development.

## 2. Webview UI (Frontend)

- **Location:** webview-ui
- **Stack:** React 19, D3.js 7, Vite, TypeScript.
- **Build Output:** Compiled to `../media/` (i.e., media in the extension root), as configured in `vite.config.ts`.

### Key Files

- **`index.html`**: Entry point for the React app.
- **`src/main.tsx`**: Mounts the React app.
- **`src/App.tsx`**: Main app component.
  - Maintains a JSON string in state.
  - Parses the JSON and builds a hierarchy for visualization.
  - Renders a header, an editor pane (for JSON), and a visualization pane (for D3).
- **`src/components/JsonEditor.tsx`**: Simple textarea-based JSON editor with error display.
- **`src/components/D3Visualization.tsx`**: (Partial code shown) Renders the JSON hierarchy using D3.js in an SVG.
- **`src/utils/parser.ts`**: Contains `buildHierarchy`, which recursively converts JSON into a tree structure suitable for D3.
- **`src/utils/types.ts`**: Type definitions for the hierarchy nodes and array items.

### Styling

- **`src/styles/App.css`**: Main layout and component styles.
- **`src/index.css`**: Global styles and resets.

### Linting & TypeScript

- **ESLint** is configured for React, TypeScript, and Vite.
- **TypeScript** is set up with strict settings and modern targets.

## 3. Integration

- The extension backend loads the built webview UI from index.js and index.css.
- The webview receives data from the extension via `postMessage`.
- The React app is designed to visualize hierarchical JSON data using D3.js, and allows editing the JSON in real time.

---

## 4. Observations & Potential Improvements

- The extension currently uses a mock JSON object; integration with real variable values (e.g., from Python) would require additional logic.
- The webview UI is modern and modular, with clear separation of concerns.
- The D3 visualization is designed to handle hierarchical data, including arrays and objects, and can handle circular references.
- The project is well-structured for both extension and frontend development, with clear build and linting processes.

---

## 5. Summary

You have a well-structured VS Code extension that provides a webview-based JSON visualizer, using a modern React/D3 frontend. The extension is currently set up for Python files and uses mock data, but the architecture supports further enhancements for real data integration and richer visualization.
